        I&apos;m a Junior Frontend Engineer with a strong foundation in web
        development and a focus on delivering high-quality, user-centric web
        applications. With a background in Computer Science from Lagos State
        University, Iâ€™ve honed my expertise in technologies such as HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js. I&apos;m driven to leverage
        these skills to build efficient, scalable, and visually compelling web
        solutions that create real value for users and businesses alike.

        When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy staying active by playing sports,
        diving into thought-provoking documentaries on YouTube, and exploring my
        favorite music on Spotify, particularly rap.
